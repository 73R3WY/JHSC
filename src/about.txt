This software is a standalone wireless suite for establishing
hostednetwork or Wi-Fi Hotspot. This software does not install any
additional software or driver in providing support for making a
hotspot because it implements the native windows support for making
a hotspot using the windows built-in "netsh" command. No files will
be created and no registry values will be registered by using this
program.

Using this software also allow you to view the current registered networks
and wireless configurations.

This software just creates a hotspot BUT not share the internet connection
to the connected clients. So if you want to share the internet connection,
please go to my website for a simple tutorial on how to share internet
connection through the created hotspot.

This software is programmed in C.
